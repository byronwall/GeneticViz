# Genetic Algorithm Visualizer
This project allows for visualization the working of a genetic algorithm.  It uses a simple block game as the basis for implementing the GA logic.  The project is currently under development.

## Getting Started
This project uses Node.js and Typescript to get things going.  To get a working copy of the webpage,
 - `npm install`
 - `gulp`
 - `npm start`

 This will give you a simple server on port 8080.  There is currently no server side interaction so you could also just open the created `index.html`.
